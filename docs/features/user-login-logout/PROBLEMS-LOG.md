## Problem 1: TypeScript Property Errors in Auth Service

Date: 2025-07-28
Task: user-login-logout

Problem: TypeScript errors in user-auth.service.ts due to property mismatches between the user model and service code. Properties like 'firstName', 'lastName', 'isEmailVerified', 'emailVerificationToken', and 'tokenExpiry' were being accessed but didn't exist in the user model.

Root Cause: The API contract expected different field names than what was in the user model. The model used 'name' (single field) instead of separate 'firstName' and 'lastName' fields, and 'isActive' instead of 'isEmailVerified'.

Solution:
1. Extended the user model interface and schema to include missing fields like 'emailVerificationToken' and 'tokenExpiry'
2. Modified the auth service code to adapt to the user model structure:
   - Split the 'name' field into firstName and lastName parts when needed
   - Used 'isActive' field as equivalent to 'isEmailVerified'
   - Added proper type handling for all fields

Prevention:
1. Always check model interfaces before implementing services
2. Document field mappings between API and database models
3. Consider using DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to formalize the transformation between API and database models
4. Add comments in code to clarify field mappings
