## Notes:
- This feature extends existing user registration/email verification system
- Backend files will be extended rather than created from scratch
- Frontend will reuse existing auth patterns and styling
- All files must stay under 400 lines as per AI optimization rules
- User model uses `name` field instead of separate `firstName` and `lastName` fields
- User model uses `isActive` field instead of `isEmailVerified`
