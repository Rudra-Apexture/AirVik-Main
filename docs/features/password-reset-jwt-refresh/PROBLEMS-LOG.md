## Known Issues from Existing System:
- JWT Token Refresh function exists but needs separate endpoint exposure
- Email infrastructure is set up but needs password reset email templates
- User model may need additional fields for password reset tokens

## Predicted Issues:
- Token security: Password reset tokens must be cryptographically secure
- Token expiry: Must implement proper token expiration (15-30 minutes)
- Rate limiting: Password reset requests need rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Email validation: Must verify email exists before sending reset token
- Password validation: Must enforce strong password requirements on reset
