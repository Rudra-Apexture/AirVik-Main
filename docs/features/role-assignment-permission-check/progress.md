## Status: Ready for Development
## Branch: feature/role-assignment-permission-check

## Task Checklist:

### Backend Phase:
- [ ] B1: MongoDB Schema Extensions (role-audit.model.ts)
- [ ] B2: Role Service Layer (role.service.ts)
- [ ] B3: Permission Middleware (permission.middleware.ts)
- [ ] B4: Role Controller (role.controller.ts)
- [ ] B5: Role Routes Configuration (role.routes.ts)
- [ ] B6: Postman Collection (API testing)

### Frontend Phase:
- [ ] F1: TypeScript Types (role.types.ts)
- [ ] F2: API Service (role.service.ts)
- [ ] F3: Role Management Components (3 components)
- [ ] F4: Admin Pages/Routes (2 pages)
- [ ] F5: Backend Integration (complete feature)

## Completed Tasks:
<!-- AI updates this after each task -->

### ✅ Preparation Phase Complete:
- ✅ **Contracts Created:** All missing contracts for role service, permission middleware, and role API
- ✅ **AI Memory System:** CURRENT-STATE.md, API-CONTRACT.md, TASK-LIST.md, PROBLEMS-LOG.md
- ✅ **Documentation:** spec.md, api.md, tasks.md, task-prompts.md, progress.md
- ✅ **Project Analysis:** Existing authentication system, user model with role field, established patterns
- ✅ **VikBooking Reference:** No existing role/permission patterns found

## Current State:
**Ready for Backend Development - Task B1**

### Files Created:
1. `shared/contracts/services/role-service.contract.ts` - Service method contracts
2. `shared/contracts/middleware/permission-middleware.contract.ts` - Permission middleware contracts  
3. `shared/contracts/api/role-api.contract.ts` - API endpoint contracts
4. `docs/features/role-assignment-permission-check/CURRENT-STATE.md` - AI tracking
5. `docs/features/role-assignment-permission-check/API-CONTRACT.md` - API specifications
6. `docs/features/role-assignment-permission-check/TASK-LIST.md` - Task order
7. `docs/features/role-assignment-permission-check/PROBLEMS-LOG.md` - Error prevention
8. `docs/features/role-assignment-permission-check/spec.md` - Feature specification
9. `docs/features/role-assignment-permission-check/api.md` - Detailed API documentation
10. `docs/features/role-assignment-permission-check/tasks.md` - Comprehensive task breakdown
11. `docs/features/role-assignment-permission-check/task-prompts.md` - Copy-paste prompts
12. `docs/features/role-assignment-permission-check/progress.md` - This file

## Next Immediate Action:
**Developer should copy prompt B1 from task-prompts.md**

## Git Status:
**Branch:** main (feature branch will be created in B1)
**Last Action:** Documentation and contracts setup complete
**Ready for:** Backend development starting with B1

## Key Dependencies Verified:
- ✅ User model has `role` field with enum validation
- ✅ Authentication middleware exists and working
- ✅ Database connection configured
- ✅ API response utilities available
- ✅ Service/Controller patterns established
- ✅ Frontend structure with Next.js 14 ready

## Critical Success Factors:
1. **Contract Compliance:** All code must follow contracts exactly
2. **File Size Limits:** Maximum 400 lines per file for AI optimization
3. **Testing Required:** Each backend task must be tested before proceeding
4. **Single Developer:** One person completes entire feature to maintain consistency
5. **Backend First:** Complete all backend tasks before starting frontend
6. **AI Memory Updates:** Update CURRENT-STATE.md after each task completion

## Feature Scope Summary:
- **5 API Endpoints:** Role assignment, retrieval, update, listing, validation
- **6 Middleware Functions:** Role and permission checking for routes
- **Role Hierarchy:** Admin > Staff > User with defined permissions
- **Audit Logging:** Track all role changes with detailed information
- **Admin UI:** Complete interface for role management
- **Permission System:** Granular access control based on roles

## Expected Timeline:
- **Backend Phase:** 6 tasks (B1-B6) - Estimated 1-2 days
- **Frontend Phase:** 5 tasks (F1-F5) - Estimated 1-2 days
- **Total Feature:** Estimated 2-4 days for complete implementation

## Testing Strategy:
- **Backend:** Postman/Newman for API testing
- **Frontend:** Component testing with mock data, then integration
- **End-to-End:** Complete role assignment workflow testing
- **Security:** Permission-based access control validation

## Success Criteria:
- [ ] Admin can assign roles to users through UI
- [ ] Role-based access control protects all endpoints
- [ ] Audit trail captures all role changes
- [ ] User list shows current roles with filtering/pagination  
- [ ] Permission validation prevents unauthorized operations
- [ ] All API endpoints return consistent response format
- [ ] Frontend handles loading states and errors gracefully
- [ ] Security requirements met (authentication, authorization, rate limiting)

## Risk Mitigation:
- **Contract Mismatches:** All prompts reference contract files
- **File Size Issues:** Each file has specific line limits
- **Integration Problems:** Backend must be complete and tested first
- **Permission Logic:** Start with simple role checks, add complexity gradually
- **Database Issues:** Verify connection and test with simple operations first

## Developer Instructions:
1. **Create feature branch:** `git checkout -b feature/role-assignment-permission-check`
2. **Start with B1:** Copy prompt from task-prompts.md exactly
3. **Test each task:** Don't proceed until current task is verified working
4. **Update tracking:** AI will update CURRENT-STATE.md after each task
5. **Follow contracts:** Reference contract files in every task
6. **Git workflow:** Commit and push after each completed task
7. **Get help:** Use PROBLEMS-LOG.md for common issues and solutions
