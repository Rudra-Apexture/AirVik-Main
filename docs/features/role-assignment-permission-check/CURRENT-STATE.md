## Last Updated: 2025-07-30T09:06:01+05:30

## What Exists Now:
<!-- AI updates this after each task -->

### ✅ Contracts Created:
- ✅ shared/contracts/services/role-service.contract.ts - Service method signatures for role management
- ✅ shared/contracts/middleware/permission-middleware.contract.ts - Middleware patterns for permission checks
- ✅ shared/contracts/api/role-api.contract.ts - API endpoints and validation for role management

### ✅ Existing Foundation:
- ✅ User model has `role: string` field with enum validation (`'user' | 'admin' | 'staff'`)
- ✅ Auth middleware exists for user authentication (`backend/src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts`)
- ✅ Service/Controller patterns established from auth system
- ✅ API response format standardized
- ✅ Project structure setup with backend/frontend separation

### ❌ What Needs Implementation:
- ❌ Backend service layer for role management
- ❌ Backend controller for role API endpoints
- ❌ Backend middleware for permission checking
- ❌ Backend routes configuration
- ❌ Frontend TypeScript types
- ❌ Frontend API service
- ❌ Frontend UI components for role management
- ❌ Frontend pages for role assignment
- ❌ API testing with Postman

## API Contracts:
<!-- Copy from API-CONTRACT.md once created -->
**Endpoints to implement:**
- POST /api/v1/roles/assign - Assign role to user
- GET /api/v1/roles/user/:userId/role - Get user's role
- PUT /api/v1/roles/update - Update user's role
- GET /api/v1/roles/users-by-role - Get users by role with pagination
- POST /api/v1/roles/validate-assignment - Validate if assignment is allowed

## Next Task: 
<!-- Current task from TASK-LIST.md -->
**B1: Create MongoDB Schema Extensions**
- Extend existing user model if needed
- Create role audit log model for tracking changes

## Git Status:
<!-- Last commit hash and message -->
**Branch:** feature/role-assignment-permission-check
**Last Action:** Created contracts for role service, permission middleware, and role API

## Known Issues:
<!-- Any problems discovered -->
- None yet - contracts created successfully
- Need to verify existing user model has all required fields for role management

## Dependencies:
- ✅ User authentication system (completed)
- ✅ User model with role field (exists)
- ✅ JWT middleware (exists)
- ✅ Database connection (exists)
- ✅ API response utilities (exists)

## Feature Scope:
**Role Assignment:** Admin users can assign/update roles for other users
**Permission Check:** Middleware to restrict access based on user roles and permissions
**Audit Logging:** Track all role changes with timestamps and reasons
**UI Management:** Frontend interface for role management (admin only)
